Problems with Linux (Ubuntu and others):
========================================

To reduce the initial delay after connecting USB you need to exclude the virtual com port from "modemmanager" to check it as a modem.

Copy the udev rule file "90-stm32vcp.rules" to "/etc/udev/rules.d" and reload udev manager with "udevadm control --reload"

Or just use the following command:

sudo bash -c 'cp 90-stm32vcp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ ; udevadm control --reload'
